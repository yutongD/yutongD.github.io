                        <h2><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2>
                        <p>Customers make a lot of reviews on online websites, e.g., Amazon and Yelp. Reviews
                            straightforwardly influence the decisions of customers, which have become a target for
                            spammers to publish malicious and fake information. The news from BBC in 2013 has shown that
                            nearly 25% of Yelp reviews could be fake [1], which remains far from fully solved now. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>However, It can be difficult for human readers to distinguish them from truthful reviews, the
                            average accuracy of three human judges is only 57.33% [2], only slightly better than random.
                            It can be expensive to detect spam manually over large review texts. We need to find
                            technical solutions to spot spammers automatically.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>To gain insight into the issue, I conducted research and experiments on the Chinese
                            restaurant review app, <i>Dianping</i>.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
                        <h4>Review itself is diverse</h4>
                        <p>We can find some obvious abnormal patterns such as “Love this place”, “Great food”, and
                            “Great service”. Actually, there are many different patterns, such as emotional tendency,
                            writing habit or mentioned aspect, which appear in mixed behaviors. It is hard to identify a
                            fixed behavior pattern or decide which characteristic is critical, which presents great
                            challenges to detect spammers. Here is an example:</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <blockquote class="inline-blockquote before-quote">
                            <p style="color: #AA84AA;font-family: 'Century Gothic';font-size: larger;">
                                The <b>food, wine, and service</b> are as <b>good</b> as everyone says.
                                Good <b>noise</b> level, fancy but not too fancy. <b>Price</b> - $200+ for the dinner.
                                <b>Food allergies</b>? - They happily accommodate them in such a seamless way that you
                                don't even notice.
                                <b>Pretentiousness of servers</b> - Not a problem at all.
                                <b>Birthday treat</b>? - Yes! Delicious little truffle cake thing.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <br><br><h4>Adversarial actions</h4>
                        <p>Spammers are smart and everywhere. Many hidden fake reviews are mixed with real reviews, and
                            at a glance, there is no difference between them. </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h2>INSIGHTS</h2>
                        <p>Broadly speaking, review spam falls into two categories. The first is people who are trying
                            to make their own business look good. The second is people who are trying to hurt others.
                            Most of the reviews on <i>Dianping</i> is the latter.
                            After observation on raw review contents on <i>Dianping</i>, I determined four influential
                            factors to generate a multi-view schema from scratch:</p>
                        <br><h4>Emotion</h4>
                        <p>I simply divided emotions into positive, negative and normal emotions. The emotional tendency
                            of fake reviews differs with various review platforms. In all spam reviews, negative reviews
                            are about three times as positive.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Aspect</h4>
                        <p>Generally, like the above example, reviews involve aspects, such as service, food, price,
                            hygiene, etc. Spammers may have specific tendency to aspect since they have the same
                            goal. </p>
                        <h4>IP Address</h4>
                        <p>An IP can be suspicious or normal. I found a strong intuition that reviews from the same user
                            or IP address tend to have similar behaviors. Spammers target to maximize profits and they
                            write as many fake reviews as possible. Therefore they may use the same user account and IP
                            address to write multiple reviews.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Rank</h4>
                        <p>Many users are accustomed to filtering restaurants by rank, so the star is also an important
                            factor to consider. Most spammers rate one star or five stars to affect the overall rating
                            as much as possible.
                        </p><br><br>
                        <h2>A MULTI-VIEW GCN FRAMEWORK</h2><br>
                        <p><img src="images/spammer/karate.png" style="margin-left: 100px"></p><br><br>
                        <p>I extracted the above four attributes (views) for each reviewer. But it’s not enough, I asked
                            myself how to maximize the review feature utility of each reviewer. Graph models came into
                            my mind. Graph means connections, which connect similar nodes together. It enables nodes to
                            use additional useful information from neighbors to gain better performance.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>After repeatedly polishing my idea, I proposed a multi-view GCN framework for spammer
                            detection.</b></p>

                        <br><h4>Neighbor Selection</h4>
                        <p>After experiments on diverse graph datasets, I discovered that GCN performs better when
                            neighboring nodes of the graph are highly similar and the adjacency matrix is neither too
                            dense nor too sparse. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>More importantly, neighbors sharing similar attributes is critical to GCN’s performance.
                            Dissimilar neighbor brings noisy to representation learning. Therefore, I conducted the
                            similarity-based neighbor selection in multiple dimensions to ensure the similarity between
                            neighbors. For example, reviewers who share an IP address are connected in the corresponding
                            graph, and reviewers who share positive emotions are connected in the emotion graph.
                            In this way, we can get high-quality graph networks that well-suited for graph embedding.
                        </p><br>
                        <h4>Graph Embedding</h4>
                        <p>From the above steps, we obtained four adjacency matric. I adopted Graph Convolutional
                            Network (GCN) [3] for graph embedding. Unlike the standard neural network, nodes in GCN
                            capture the neighbor’s properties and properties aggregate during the convolution operation.
                            The network tries to learn the embedding for each of the nodes through mutual sharing of
                            data among the nodes’ neighbors in an iterative manner until convergence..</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Furthermore, I gained amazing findings. In our application scenario, the graph network can
                            leverage the relational ties between users with minimal to no external information. In other
                            words, it performs better when nodes attribute is replaced by adjacency matrix. This change
                            enables GCN to learn global structural relational information (the whole graph), which
                            further improve the feature utility. </p>
                        <br><h4>Classifier </h4>
                        <p>The last step is to add a LR classifier or XGB classifier. The classifier utilizes embedding
                            from four views collectively to output the label of reviewers .
                        </p><br><br>
                        <h2>ADVANTAHES</h2>
                        <p>(1) The framework identify explicit or latent connections between spammers from reviews
                            characteristic in multiple views, which maximizes review utility and improve the
                            accuracy. </p>
                        <br><p>(2) The framework exhibits a good performance with only a small amount of training data (1%)
                            which alleviates the costly labeling problem.</p>
                        <br><p>(3) It is an end-to-end learning framework. It takes labeled nodes and the graph as the input
                            and output the predicted classes of unlabeled nodes</p>
